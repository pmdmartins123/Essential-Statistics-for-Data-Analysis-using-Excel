Hi, since our course is called Essential Statistics for

1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,190
Data Analysis Using Excel,

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,690
we should probably start off talking about what we mean by data.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,050
So data is made up of individuals and variables.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,470
Okay, so what do we mean by individuals?

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,730
Individuals are the objects described by the data set.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,480
Individuals might be people, stocks, cities, etc.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,530
So do we mean by a variable?

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,060
A variable is a characteristic of an individual and

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,510
here are some examples.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,050
So the individual might be a person.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,870
So what variables might you associate with a person?

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,600
Well, their height, their weight, their IQ, the number of siblings,

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,680
perhaps their family income.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,958
If the individual is a city,

15
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,140
what are some variables you might associate with a city?

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,370
The population of the city, the area of the city,

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,270
the total income of individuals in the city.

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,880
If the individual is a stock,

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,110
what variable might you associate with a stock?

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,410
Well, there are many, but you might look at the price of the stock

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,448
during each day in the year 2020, or whatever year you're interested in.

22
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:03,683
If your individual is a car,

23
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:06,570
there are many variables you might associate with a car.

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,571
The color of the car, the horsepower of the car.

25
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,150
You might use the miles per gallon.

26
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,170
There are just so many.

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,010
Okay, so the next thing we wanna talk about are variables, okay?

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,420
And there are two types of variables, categorical or numerical.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,990
Okay, so a numerical or

30
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,870
sometimes a quantitative variable takes a numerical value.

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,950
A numerical value can be a mistake.

32
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,760
A numerical variable can be discrete or continuous.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,710
A discrete variable assumes distinct values,

34
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,800
whereas continuous variable can assume any value within a range.

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,132
Often a discrete variable assumes an integer value.

36
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:44,511
Here are some examples.

37
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:47,465
If we look at the market share for a cholesterol drug,

38
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:50,070
that's a continuous variable, why?

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,121
Cuz you can take on any value between zero and

40
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,400
one, any value in an interval.

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,060
Profit margin for a product is continuous.

42
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,180
Again, it can take on any value between zero and one.

43
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,010
The number of children in a family is discrete.

44
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,146
You could have zero children in a family, one child, two child,

45
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:09,641
I don't know, the Guinness Book of World Records may be 25 children.

46
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:13,500
The number of days a child misses of school in a year is discrete.

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,190
They can miss zero days hopefully, one day, two days.

48
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,560
If there's 180 days of school I suppose they can miss 180 days.

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,440
I hope they're not that sick.

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,720
Height and weight are continuous.

51
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,743
Now you might think, if you're a man,

52
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:29,605
that your height might be 5 foot 10, 5 foot 11 or 6 feet.

53
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:33,665
But your height could be sort of any number, let's say between 2 feet and

54
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:34,201
8 feet.

55
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:38,488
So basically your height, if you say you're 6 feet tall,

56
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:41,766
it may mean you're 72.0000 inches.

57
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:44,425
The annual return on a stock is continuous.

58
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:47,657
The worst thing that could happen to a stock, it loses all its value,

59
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:50,620
you would have a minus 100% return during a year.

60
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,250
But there is no upper limit on what the return on the stock could be.

61
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,330
Now, we also wanna talk about non-numerical or

62
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,350
quantitative variables called categorical variables.

63
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,250
Also, the term used is qualitative variables.

64
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,550
And we classify a variable into one of several categories.

65
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,149
So a categorical variable can be nominal or ordinal.

66
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,706
For a nominal variable,

67
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:15,790
the categories cannot be assigned a numerical value.

68
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,380
For ordinal data, the categories can be sorted in a logical fashion.

69
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,880
So here are some examples of categorical variables.

70
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,800
The color of a car is nominal.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,030
I mean, I don't think there's any ordering where you can order a green

72
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,400
car over a red car over a silver car.

73
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,870
The age group of a person in the US, Generation X, Millenial,

74
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,290
Baby Boomers common classifications, that's ordinal.

75
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,130
Cuz basically based on your birth date,

76
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,100
you're classified in one of these groups.

77
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,010
If you're older or you were born in 1946-1964, you're a Baby Boomer.

78
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,468
The Gen X is 65-80 and the Millenials, in the 80s and 90s.

79
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:55,900
So there is a numerical order that can be associated there.

80
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,150
Basically, we would have an ordinal categorical variable.

81
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,636
Your party affiliation United States, Republican, Democrat,

82
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:05,260
Libertarian or Independent, that's nominal.

83
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,350
I don't think that you can place a numerical order on that.

84
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,220
Rating a teacher,

85
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,330
which is controversial in the US as excellent, good, average or poor.

86
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,601
Now that is ordinal because basically you might base those

87
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:22,784
ratings on teacher evaluations, you might say a seven or

88
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:26,375
a six is excellent, a five or four is good, etc.

89
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:30,199
In our next video, we'll talk about how we can summarize quantitative or

90
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,060
numerical data using histograms.
