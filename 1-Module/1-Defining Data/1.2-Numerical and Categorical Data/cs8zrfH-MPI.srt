0
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,000
Data can take on one of two forms.

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,235
It can be categorical,

2
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:08,150
meaning that it classifies as a variable into a specific category.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,690
Gender is a great example of a categorical variable.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,350
You either identify yourself as a male or female.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,960
Sometimes you will hear data called qualitative.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,670
Qualitative data is categorical data, just by a different name.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,320
Or data can be numerical or quantitative.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,060
In this case, the numbers have meaning.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,780
Generally, larger numbers mean more of something.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,930
Weight, height, temperature are examples of numerical variables.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,990
Further, numerical variables can be discrete or continuous.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,800
Discrete variables take on a specific value and

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,040
must be an integer.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,920
The number of vehicles that you own, or the number of flights that you

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,570
took this year, are examples of discrete variables.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,260
You can't have a part of a car, or take part of a flight.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,650
Continuous variables can take on any value within a range.

18
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,032
Weight, temperature are continuous variables because something might

19
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:58,010
weigh a fraction of a pound or a kilo, or

20
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,540
temperature can be somewhere between two values on a scale.
