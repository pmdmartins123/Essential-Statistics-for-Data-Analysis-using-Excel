Let's start at the beginning, statistics is the process of

1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,360
collecting, organizing, and interpreting data.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,531
Data consist of individuals and variables.

3
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:11,353
Individuals are the objects of interest in your study, in other

4
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:14,084
words, what you are collecting your information or data on.

5
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:17,801
They can be actual individuals or people, or they can be other objects

6
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:22,030
such as cities, animals, products, stocks, anything, really.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,820
Variables are characteristics of those individuals or

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,890
the attributes that you are measuring, such as height, weight,

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,570
age, satisfaction with something or the population size of a city,

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,970
average income, median house price, and average temperature.

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,610
A great way to store your data is in a spreadsheet.

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,140
Data typically takes this form where the rows are individuals and

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,820
the columns are variables.

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,570
In this example, each row represents a survey respondent and each column,

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,280
a piece of information or data that was gathered about that respondent.
