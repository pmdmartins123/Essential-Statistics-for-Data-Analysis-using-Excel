0
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,370
So another way to summarize hierarchical data

1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,180
is a sunburst chart.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,690
And it's got some advantages and

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,460
some disadvantages over the treemap chart, as we'll see.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,330
So we can select our data for the bookstore again.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,388
And all we gotta do is insert, go to right here, and

6
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:19,968
instead of selecting Treemap, Sunburst.

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:24,070
Okay, you can see it sorta looks like the sun there.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,560
Okay, the disadvantage is you can't really, I think the human eye,

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,520
really spot what fraction of the area goes with each product.

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,170
The rectangles are easier I think for us to work with as human beings.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,410
But the advantage here, you can see here H three through five,

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,300
I've got the breakdown of how the books went on the age three through

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,810
five kids, okay?

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,510
And I did not have that breakdown when I did the treemap chart.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,800
But that's really all there is to sunburst charts.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,110
You have to experiment with the right size, but

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,080
basically you can really see the hierarchical relationship better,

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,620
I think, in this case.

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,710
But you really, I don't think, can judge.

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,119
You can see the children's books for the highest percentage in the mag

21
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:07,450
and science fantasy, fiction fantasy, and do that well.

22
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,720
But I think with the rectangles,

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,880
it's easier to see the particular percentage there.

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,671
Now again, hovering over a particular point,

25
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:15,115
shows you the numerical value there.

26
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:20,158
So, in our next lesson, we're going to talk about Pareto charts,

27
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:23,797
which are really nicely done in Excel 2016.

28
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:26,320
So, we'll get to that in a few minutes
