Okay in this lesson we're gonna discuss hierarchical data.

1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,050
Now I'm not sure I can say that word right so just bear with me.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,545
So hierarchical data is a way to organize data with multiple

3
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:12,200
one-to-many relationships.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,870
The structure is based on the rule that one parent can have many

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,050
children, but a child can have only one parent.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,030
So let's look at example.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,950
We could look at food.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,420
So we could look at ice cream, so that would be the parent.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,110
And the children might be gelato ice cream, low fat ice cream,

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,600
high fat ice cream, or brands of ice cream.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,430
Okay, we could look at cereals.

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,230
Okay, that would be the parent.

13
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,260
And the children would be bran, granola, oatmeal.

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,260
There could be other things there.

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,550
And fruit could be the parent.

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,200
We might have apple, pears, plums and grapes.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,410
Another example, we could look at enrollments in a college.

18
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,370
So we could look at HPER, the School of Health,

19
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,620
Physical Education and Recreation, okay, that would be the parent.

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,400
And then the children would be basically students

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,460
enrolled in public health, kinesiology or parks administration.

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,360
We might have the College of Arts and Sciences,

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,570
that would be the parent.

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,060
The children, and I'm not being exhaustive here,

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,940
would be basically students enrolled in sociology,

26
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,720
chemistry, mathematics, English, history or psychology.

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,050
We might have business school being the parent.

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,730
And we might have the children being basically

29
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,100
students enrolled in accounting, finance, marketing, and operations.

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,870
So we can learn in the next videos how we can

31
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,550
use two new exciting charts from Excel 2016, the tree map and

32
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,320
the sunburst charts, to summarize hierarchical data.
