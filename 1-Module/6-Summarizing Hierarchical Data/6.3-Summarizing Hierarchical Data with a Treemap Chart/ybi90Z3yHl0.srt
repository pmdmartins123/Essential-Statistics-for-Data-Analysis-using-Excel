00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,050
In this video, we're gonna show you how to create an exciting Treemap

1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,420
chart to summarize hierarchical data.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,630
So, suppose you own an independent bookstore, and basically,

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,860
in column A you have sort of the major types of books you sell,

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,040
arts and photography, nonfiction.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,419
You may sell some magazine,

6
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:21,690
science fiction and fantasy which some people like.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,950
And then you have sub genre.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,562
So, basically, for

9
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:27,410
children's book, you may have baby books aged three through five.

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,898
And there is no sub genre for

11
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:31,307
baby books before aged three through five.

12
00:00:31,307 --> 00:00:33,305
We have first readers, ABCs and for

13
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:36,303
those parents who really wanna get their kids going,

14
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:39,567
we have Tolstoy for Tots that you can learn all about War and

15
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:43,500
Peace and Anna Karenina, the two greatest novels ever written.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,490
So we have the revenue for each of these categories.

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,350
We wanna summarize, basically,

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,700
which of our books are selling a lot, okay?

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,830
Cuz these numbers just don't tell us much.

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,190
A chart is always a better way to summarize data if

21
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,080
you can come up with the right chart.

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,530
So, basically, if I just select this data, and

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,690
all I have to do is do Insert.

24
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,980
And then, what's new here is right here.

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,430
There's Treemap and Sunburst hierarchy chart.

26
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,420
So, let's do Treemap right here.

27
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,120
Now, we wanna make this bigger.

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,220
But basically, the areas are proportional to the numbers that we

29
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,190
have in the last column.

30
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,440
Okay, so we have the children's books,

31
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,140
we've got basically the 1st Readers, ABCs, Tolstoy for Tots, we can see

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,670
1st Readers was the best seller from the children's books there.

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,850
We can see that up here, the 24,000, and

34
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:44,090
if you hover over a number here, it should show you, basically,

35
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,920
right there, see there you can see the numerical value there.

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,370
And we can change the way these labels look in a minute.

37
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,410
Now, the problem is, what size should you make this chart?

38
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,710
So, I mean, you don't wanna make it too big or

39
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,780
basically, you couldn't print it or see all of it.

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,430
But if you make it bigger, you're gonna get more detail.

41
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,820
So, you just have to experiment with what size you want this thing to be.

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,850
But the main lesson we learned here is the orange,

43
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,800
the children's book, are the biggest percentage of our sales.

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,630
We don't sell much science fiction and fantasy.

45
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,120
We might use this reallocate our shelf space.

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,560
Then, are magazines here, we can see are in green.

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,040
But, basically, this is a really nice way to summarize for

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,670
a company that sells stuff what, basically,

49
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,670
are the products that you're selling.

50
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,730
Now if I right click in a blank space here and

51
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,030
do Format Data Series, I can change this to say banner.

52
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,940
So now, the labels look a little bit different which I think looks

53
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,748
a little bit better.

54
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:41,108
So that Treemap chart is one great way to summarize hierarchical data.

55
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:45,358
In the next video, we'll see a Sunburst chart which

56
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:50,310
basically can also be used to summarize hierarchical data.

57
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,289
See the one thing here that's the problem is,

58
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:55,538
I didn't see the breakdown for the age three through five kids.

59
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:56,903
Okay, and basically,

60
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:59,912
we'll see in the Sunburst chart that would show up.
