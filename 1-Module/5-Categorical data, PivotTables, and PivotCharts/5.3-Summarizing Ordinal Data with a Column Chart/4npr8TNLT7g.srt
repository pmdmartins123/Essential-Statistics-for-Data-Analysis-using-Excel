00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,470
In this video we're gonna learn how to graphically describe categorical

1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,160
ordinal data.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,090
So let's start with numerical data and try and put some categories in.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,880
So we have the age of people that live in your town.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,375
So how many people do we have?

5
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,050
5,000 people.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,897
And so we might wanna break this up in to categories,

7
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:22,240
0-9 years old, 10-19, 20-29, 80-90.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,940
Pivot table makes this a snap.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,590
So select the data, including the heading.

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,120
Go insert, pivot table.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,860
And we'll put this in the existing worksheet.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,420
And then we'll pick age here.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,630
Now, we want to count how many people in each age group.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,200
We've got to be careful here.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,980
See, it says, sum of age.

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,440
Excel was thinking you want to add these up. Okay.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,930
So, like, for

18
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,560
six year olds, they add up to 300.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,150
That means there's 50 six year olds.

20
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,170
But if you double click here, you can change this to count.

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,750
So now there's 50 six year olds.

22
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,950
But still, we want to put categories in there.

23
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,870
We want to group those ages.

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,710
So if you right click here, you can do group.

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,960
You can do ten year increments.

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,500
Zero through 90 in ten year increments.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,530
See now we could graph this to get an idea of

28
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,200
basically the age distribution.

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,330
We could do percentages but we'll just leave it like this.

30
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,740
So we would do insert.

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,310
Okay, so we analyze.

32
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,920
And then basically Pivot Chart again.

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,930
And that column chart is absolutely fine.

34
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,930
And so now we've summarized our categorical ordinal data.

35
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,390
You can see there's a numerical order here.

36
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,880
The 90 year olds are older than the 0 to the nine year olds.

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,220
We can see the most common age group was baby bloomers, 50 to 59.

38
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,000
Now in the next video we'll show you an important way to summarize

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,660
categorical data known as cross tabs.
