0
00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:03,648
It is important to understand that not only can your data be

1
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:05,070
different types.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,040
Remember the categorical qualitative or

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,170
numerical quantitative conversation we had earlier?

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,090
It also has a scale of measurement associated with it that describes

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,820
what the values mean.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,490
This is important because the interpretation of statistical

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,250
analysis is based on underlying assumptions about the type of data

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,280
and its scale of measurement among other characteristics.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,350
Just because you can run a statistic on some data doesn't mean that

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,580
the results will actually make sense.

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,220
Further, different visualizations or charts should be used depending on

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,820
the scale of measurement and data type.

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,120
Data can be nominal, which means that the values associated with that

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,350
variable represent identifiers.

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,910
These are unranked categorizations.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,300
For example, demographic information, such as gender, race or

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,470
ethnicity, color of a car.

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,280
Those might be nominal.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,530
Because you can only do statistical analysis on number, not words.

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,010
You would have to assign a code to differentiate between genders for

21
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,940
example.

22
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,120
This is what we call a dummy code.

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,010
For example, you might characterize women as one and men as two.

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,950
Here is an example of when running some statistics, mean for example,

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,270
makes no sense.

26
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,398
If you ran a mean on a nominal variable such as gender,

27
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:21,180
what would 1.25 mean in this context?

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,410
Data can be ordinal where values associated with that value represent

29
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,790
rank ordered category.

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,620
So that the values have meaning relative to each other such as low,

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,880
moderate or high.

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,000
But the distance between each category doesn't have any meaning

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,160
and may not be equivalent.

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,110
Variables can also be interval, where the measurements are on

35
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,830
a numerical scale with an arbitrary zero point that has no meaning.

36
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,750
For example, zero degrees Fahrenheit means cold, not no heat.

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,140
Similar to ordinal data,

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,630
the distance between the points isn't the same across the scale.

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,390
For example, 60 degrees is not twice as warm as 30 degrees.

40
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,730
Finally, the variables can have a ratio scale of measurement.

41
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,564
In this case,

42
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:08,193
values are on a numerical scale with a meaningful zero point.

43
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:12,060
$0 means you have no money.

44
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,210
As a result, values can be compared in terms of their interval and

45
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,460
ratio scales.

46
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:23,714
So 30 times $30 is three times more than $10.
