00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,270
You recall earlier in this module we discussed categorical data, so

1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,250
now let's return to that.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,760
There are two types of categorical data, nominal and ordinal.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,360
So how can we graphically summarize nominal and

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,380
ordinal categorical data?

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,160
Let's talk first about nominal categorical data.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,630
So here we have an example.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,380
We have colors of US cars.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,620
Okay, so what are some ways that we could summarize this data?

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:32,020
Well, we're gonna use a pivot table tool to basically find out how many

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,000
cars were of each color or the percentage of cars of each color.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,470
We'll do the percentage.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,410
Okay, so now we can select this data here.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,970
And if you're not familiar with pivot tables,

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,380
you can follow these steps pretty easily and

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,230
the book has a lot of stuff on this.

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,296
Insert pivot table, okay, now we'll say the current worksheet,

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,720
Okay, now we wanna drag the car type here.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,320
All the colors are there and then value is right here.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,090
It's gonna count how many cars of each type, there were 500 cars here.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,760
Now we can leave it like this to summarize, but maybe we want to know

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,630
the percentage of basically cars that were each color.

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,660
So then you can right-click on a pivot table.

23
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,130
Right-clicking is very helpful.

24
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,350
Right-click and

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,340
we can do Summarize > Show Values as Percentage of Column.

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,260
Now we see what percentage of the cars were each color.

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,052
Now you may want the car that's most common here,

28
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,930
gray or white to be on top.

29
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,150
You could go here and go Data Sort, you don't have to do that.

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,631
We will go largest to smallest.

31
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:49,490
Now we can do a chart.

32
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,530
So we can do a column chart or we could do a pie chart, okay.

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,220
So we want to do a column chart.

34
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,400
Basically go analyze,

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,650
you can create a chart from the pivot table by clicking on Analyze.

36
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,030
Okay, and then there's PivotChart and you can pick your type of chart.

37
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,995
Now the column chart is fine for me now.

38
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,200
So I can see the percentage of cars that basically were each color.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,460
It goes grey, white, silver, I think I'm a little low on green.

40
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,190
I think a lot more cars are green than what I have here, but

41
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,140
that's okay.

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,480
But you might also wanna summarize this as a pie chart.

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,260
So you want to summarize this as a pie chart,

44
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,960
you can always change the type of chart.

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,170
You can go right-click, Change Chart Type, okay, so I can go pie chart.

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,760
Okay, now that's a pretty boring pie chart cuz it doesn't have any

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,400
numbers inside there.

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,720
It does have the orange being the black car, etc.

49
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,090
But then if you go up into Excel, you go Format, sorry, Design.

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,020
Add Chart Element.

51
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,200
And you can go Data Labels and say More Label Options.

52
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,369
Okay, and now I wanna show the value and

53
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:04,820
I wanna show the category name in this cell.

54
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,455
Okay, so that would show like the brown cars were 8.3%, etc, and

55
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,824
I think that's a better pie chart.

56
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:20,540
So that let's you summarize again our nominal categorical data.

57
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,280
But we could have done it with a column chart.

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,930
I guess I like the pie chart better.

59
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,660
A lot of statisticians don't like pie charts, but

60
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,041
I think that's fairly nice there to show you what's going on.

61
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,491
In our next video, we'll talk about ordinal data and

62
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,260
how we can summarize that.

63
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,530
Again, the PivotTable will be the key basis of how we do this.
