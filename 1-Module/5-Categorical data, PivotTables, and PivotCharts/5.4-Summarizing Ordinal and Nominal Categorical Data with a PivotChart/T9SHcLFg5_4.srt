00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,410
In this video, we'll discuss a really important way to

1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,410
analyze categorical data known as cross tabulation.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,290
What you wanna do is figure out how several categorical variables affect

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,910
the different categorical variables.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,580
So here's an example.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,820
So, people don't really buy station wagons anymore.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,320
But suppose you have a bunch of families,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,580
yes means they bought a station wagon, no means they didn't.

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,800
Then the family size is either large or small.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,350
These are all categorical.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,780
Large family is more than two children, small family

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,390
is zero to two children then their salaries is either high or low.

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,860
So looking at this data which has no numbers, can we create

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,704
a table which sort of tells us what causes people to buy station wagons,

14
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,450
or what demographics are associated with station wagons.

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,670
So a pivot table will work out really well with this.

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,290
Now I should basically put my cursor anywhere inside the data.

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,384
I can do insert pivot table.

18
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:56,780
Okay.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,530
And then you can see the series range there is B2 to through D345.

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,940
Excel picked it out.

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,910
I don't have to select the range, I can just be inside there.

22
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,749
Now I'll do existing let's say right down here.

23
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:13,300
Okay, now how do I want to lay this out?

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,450
So I wanna know yes or no, did they buy a station wagon?

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,820
So that'll go in the column field.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,950
I wanna count that, so I'll put that in the values field.

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,750
And then the demographics or the other qualitative variables

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,560
I'll list in the row field, the order doesn't matter, but

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,580
I'll do family size and then I'll do salary.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,040
So now I have a count of how many people fall into each group.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,780
For example, large families with high salaries,

32
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,860
there's 34 people who did not buy a wagon.

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,780
Now if you wanna be a positive person,

34
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,900
you might want yes on the left.

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,600
You can click on column labels, sort z to a.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,370
Now yes is on the left, not that that matters.

37
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,360
Now this breakdown isn't very meaningful, you need a percentage.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,970
In other words, in each of those demographic groups,

39
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,550
what percentage bought a wagon?

40
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,930
That's what's known as cross tabs and we will return to cross tabs in

41
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,000
module five when we talk about the Chi squared test for independence.

42
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,900
So right here if I would go right click and

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,510
I could show values as percentage of row.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,500
See now I know what percentage in each group bought the wagon.

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,160
We'll do this with a graph in a minute but

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,370
you can see the large families.

47
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,180
No matter what their salary, about 70% bought a wagon.

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,960
The small families, about 5%, no matter what their salaries,

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,190
bought a wagon.

50
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,210
So basically that means that the salary doesn't really matter,

51
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,790
it's the family size.

52
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,750
And so that's what a cross tabs analysis can show you.

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,370
Now again, if I want to go in there and

54
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,950
go analyze, pivot chart, this one will be absolutely fine.

55
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,958
Let's just move this over to the right here.

56
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,250
Or move it down let's say.

57
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,860
And basically our pivot chart shows us, okay, the large family is,

58
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,880
blue is the percentage that bought.

59
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,160
Okay, we can see no matter what the salary, high or low.

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,930
Lots of people bought, but small families, no matter what the salary,

61
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,720
high or low, not many people bought.

62
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,190
So we can see clearly here from our cross tabs analysis

63
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,120
that basically salary was less important than family size

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,720
in determining who bought a station wagon.

65
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,629
In the next lesson, we'll turn our attention to hierarchical data which

66
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,034
can be analyzed in a really neat fashion using Excel

67
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:34,217
2016's new sunburst and treemap charts.
