In this video we're gonna talk about some common shapes of histograms

1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,880
that you should be able to recognize.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,927
And also how you can use histograms to compare different variables.

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:13,590
So let's look at IQs again which we looked at in the last video.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,850
So I have a slightly different data set so I have a histogram of IQs.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,520
And as we mentioned this is what we call a symmetric histogram.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,890
If you look at the most frequently occurring bin, the highest bin,

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,500
it looks sorta the same, one bin to the left, one bin to the right, etc.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,850
Then another very common type of histogram is something like

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,980
income in a city or a county or even a country.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,130
This does not look symmetric at all.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,030
Here you have the most frequently occurring income in the US,

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,720
or based on my fake data.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,490
And then basically this is certainly not symmetric.

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,974
You see basically the bars here go much further to the right of

15
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:54,968
the peak than the left of the peak.

16
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:58,250
So that's called skewed right or positively skewed.

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,020
Because again, the bars go much further to the right of the most

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,895
frequently occurring income than they go to the left.

19
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:07,210
This is very common in economic and financial data.

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,420
Now negatively skewed data is not that common to be honest but

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,110
here's an example.

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,847
The number of days from conception til a woman gives birth, okay.

23
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:20,477
Now the most common number of days would be roughly 280 days or

24
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:21,512
nine months.

25
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:24,008
And I don't know what the Guinness Book of World Records is for

26
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:25,643
the most days from conception to birth.

27
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:28,735
I'm sure no woman wants to experience that.

28
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:32,421
But basically we can see you can't go much over nine months or

29
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:34,311
the doctor will induce labor.

30
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:36,851
So maybe suppose the record is 300 days,

31
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,882
the bars would go a little bit to the right of 280.

32
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:43,445
But they go much further to the left because babies thankfully can be

33
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:46,144
born healthy at six months, six and a half months.

34
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:49,960
Maybe some of you watching this video fall into that category.

35
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,300
So there we would have data that's skewed to the left because the bars

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,650
go further to the left were negatively skewed.

37
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,197
Now we can also use histograms to compare visually data from different

38
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:02,053
variables.

39
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:04,218
So if we look at returns on Cisco and

40
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:08,039
GM which we'll talk a lot about in these videos here, okay.

41
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,551
We've got histograms for the monthly returns on GM and

42
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,162
Cisco in the 1990s.

43
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:16,747
And so we've made those histograms basically be set

44
00:02:16,747 --> 00:02:19,524
up with the same set of axes here, okay.

45
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:23,880
And then basically what can we say from these two histograms?

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,150
If we look at typical value for GM and Cisco, what can we say?

47
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,420
Well, Cisco goes further to the right so

48
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,870
the typical return on Cisco in the 1990s

49
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,810
would be basically higher than the typical return on GM.

50
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,110
We can also, as we'll see later, look at that spread about the mean.

51
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,550
You can see the Cisco returns are more spread out.

52
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,320
You have more up here.

53
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,510
You have more down here and less in the middle.

54
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,630
With regards to the skewness,

55
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,620
these both look fairly symmetric as histograms.

56
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,040
So we really can't say much about

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,160
the difference in the skewness basically of Cisco and GM returns.

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,700
And we'll see this quantified with numerical statistics in a couple of

59
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,311
videos.

60
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:07,619
So now that we know to create histograms to visually summarize

61
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:08,263
a dataset.

62
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:12,071
We want to turn our attention to basically coming up with numerical

63
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,180
measures that summarize a data set.
