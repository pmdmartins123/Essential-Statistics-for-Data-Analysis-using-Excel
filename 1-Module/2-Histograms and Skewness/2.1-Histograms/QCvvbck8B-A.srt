A histogram is a fancy bar chart.

1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,810
The difference between a histogram and

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,100
a bar chart is that histograms show bars for

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,390
ranges of numbers, rather than for a single value as most bar charts do.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,590
In addition, histograms are used to display continuous data,

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,430
whereas bar charts are used to display discreet data.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,640
As a result, the bars in histograms touch, but

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,338
they do not touch on bar charts.

8
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:25,860
To construct a histogram, the first step is to bin the range of values,

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,520
that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,050
And then count how many values fall into each of your intervals.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,345
The bins are consecutive,

12
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:39,240
non-overlapping intervals of values associated with a variable.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,970
The bins must be adjacent and are often, but

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,580
not required to be, of equal size.

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,900
In this case, we are summarizing the number of widgets sold each day for

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,600
two months.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,080
We created bins the size of 20.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,520
Histograms, like bar charts, are valuable tools, because they allow

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,860
us to better understand the shape or distribution of our data.

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,760
In general, we want our data to be normally distributed,

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,270
meaning it's symmetrical.

22
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,010
When it's not,

23
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,930
it's skewed, with data clustered at one end or the other.

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,420
As data analysis, symmetrical, or normally distributed data,

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,410
is not only pleasing to the eye, but to our spirits as well.

26
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,800
Because many statistical analyses assume normality of data.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,900
In other words, if your data aren't normally distributed, you won't be

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,670
able to make the correct interpretation of your results.
