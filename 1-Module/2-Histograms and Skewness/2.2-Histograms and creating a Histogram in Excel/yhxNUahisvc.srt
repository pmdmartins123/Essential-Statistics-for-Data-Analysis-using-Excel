A common method of summarizing data is

1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,000
a histogram that the data is numerical.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,940
So basically, a histogram, you divide

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,318
the range of values in your data into 5 to 15 groups or bins.

4
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:14,870
Usually they have equal width,

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,346
and you simply count how many observations in each bin, and

6
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:23,800
draw a nice column or a bar graph to summarize where the data is.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,488
And Excel in previous versions through Excel 2016 did histograms,

8
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:29,612
but they really didn't look that great.

9
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:34,220
But in Excel 2016, they look fantastic.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,660
So let's look at a sample of IQs of, let's say,

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,950
students at a high school.

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,081
We've got about 1,000 kids there.

13
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:45,370
And we want to summarize the IQs in a histogram.

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,880
Well, what you have to decide is basically,

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,040
how many bins you want and basically a lower limit,

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,325
sort of to cut off everybody below that limit in the first bin, and

17
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:58,505
everybody above the upper limit in the last bin.

18
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:03,489
So for IQs, we know something about the value of IQs from just our

19
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:05,257
worldly experience.

20
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:07,674
We're gonna put everybody who is 55 or

21
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:12,093
below in the lowest bin, everybody who is 145 or over in the upper bin.

22
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:15,053
And we like to have nice round bins, we don't want

23
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:18,870
bins like 8.55 in width, so we'll have a bin width of 10.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,940
So how do we create a histogram in Excel?

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,750
We first select the data.

26
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,995
So we'll start with the first IQ,

27
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:27,300
Control+Shift+down arrow goes down to the bottom.

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,030
Then we'll do Insert.

29
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,800
Okay, and then right here, this is new to 2016,

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,530
there's the histogram option, and so there we have a histogram.

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,800
This one we don't need.

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,770
Okay, so now what we wanna do,

33
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,730
we have these ugly bin boundaries, we wanna switch that.

34
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,510
So we go right click, Format Axis.

35
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,247
Okay, now Bin Width we said we want that to be 10.

36
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:58,335
Okay, Overflow Bin would be the upper one.

37
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:02,320
We want that to be 145, we've got that.

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,270
Underflow Bin 55, okay.

39
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,410
And then basically, we've got our histogram, so we can label this IQs.

40
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:15,810
Okay, now what that tells us is roughly,

41
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,970
how many of the students here have IQs in each range?

42
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,325
So our first bin is below 55 and above 145.

43
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,969
It doesn't appear that there are any, but

44
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:30,304
the most frequently occurring IQ range is 95 to 105, which makes

45
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:35,330
sense cuz you know the average IQ Is around 100, it's supposed to be 100.

46
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,520
And we can also see this IQ graph is what we call, or

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,550
histogram is called symmetric,

48
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,180
because it looks sort of the same to the left and right of the peak here.

49
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,130
Go one bar to the left, one bar to the right,

50
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,090
the heights are pretty much the same.

51
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,880
Two bars to the left, two bars to the right,

52
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,800
the heights are pretty much the same, etc.

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,890
And in our next video,

54
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,070
we'll explore more the most common shapes of histograms.
