00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,420
So in this video we'll show you how to create a pirato chart using a new

1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,660
Excel 2016 capability which illustrates the fact that

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,130
a small percentage of our products generate most of our revenue.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,630
So I've listed a bunch of products here, how many do I have?

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,840
I think a hundred.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,740
They don't have to be in any order, notice the first product

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,440
doesn't make much money but the second product does and

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,540
basically we would like to have a Pareto chart.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,430
So all we have to do is select our data, okay, go insert, and

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,940
where we found the box and whisker plot, and basically the histogram.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,740
There's the Pareto chart, the lines and the bars.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,440
There is a Pareto chart.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,210
So you can see we've listed the product sales in descending order.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,210
Product two was our best product, sold the most.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,996
And then basically product 64, etc.

15
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:51,560
And then this red bar, red line here,

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,120
gives the percentage of our sales by the products reading left to right.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,930
So you can see they get 80% basically of your basically,

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,690
your revenue,

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,480
you would follow the 80% over the year until the red line hits 80%.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,940
Noticed that the red line gets flatter.

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,730
Why is that?

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,800
The red curve.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,290
Because basically every time

24
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,920
you increase the x-axis by one you're adding a new product.

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,950
The y axis the slope is basically based on what you're adding in

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,450
revenue.

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,030
And you can see that basically, when you're adding later products,

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,960
you're adding less in revenue, so the curve gets flat.

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,290
Notice when you get down here, you're not adding much percentage

30
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,810
to the coverage of sales but at the beginning you're adding a lot there.

31
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,710
And it turns out in this example 36 products would basically

32
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,300
give you 80% in your revenues so wasn't quite a Pareto

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,540
principle that 20 out of 100 generated 80% as your revenue.

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,170
But in real data I have seen it really does hold that 20% of your

35
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,500
products will usually generate 80% of your revenue or

36
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,280
profit, or 20% of your customers generate 80% of your profit.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,670
Now in the next video we'll show you how to create

38
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,240
a Pareto Chart that basically you would use in quality control

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,420
to sort of summarize complaints about a restaurant.

40
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,740
And you'll see you can't quite use the Pareto capability right off

41
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,005
the bat that we've used here because the data is qualitative and

42
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,370
it's not listed numerically.
