In the last video in this module,

1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,920
we're gonna teach you how to do a Pareto chart,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,690
sort of based on customer complaints, okay?

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,944
So, let's suppose you own a small restaurant.

4
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:11,138
And hopefully, you don't get that many complaints, but

5
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:12,136
here are the complaints.

6
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:16,562
Small Portions, the wait staff was rude, the taste of the product it

7
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:21,620
didn't taste very good, and then there's too salty, dirty, etc.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,560
Okay, not happy to hear this if you run a restaurant.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,960
So, we'd like to summarize these complaints with a Pareto chart.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,540
Now, unfortunately, the way that Excel has set up the Pareto chart,

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,230
we can't do it right off the bat, but

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,080
we can use a pivot table to summarize this data.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,170
We will keep track of how many of each complaint occurred with

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,560
a pivot table, and

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,230
then we'll have to extract that data from the pivot table because

16
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,960
Excel is not equipped to do Pareto charts from a pivot table.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,000
But this will take a minute or two.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,390
So, okay, all we have to do is select our data,

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,170
we'll do insert a pivot table, Excel understands.

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,300
Actually, we could've just been anywhere inside that data.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,741
We'll do existing worksheet.

22
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:07,070
And now, we see how many complaints we had if we drag complaints to

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,120
the row, complaints to the value.

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,130
We can see, unfortunately, the taste and

25
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,840
the wait staff being rude hurt us.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,560
Now, if I just copy this stuff out, then I can do the Pareto chart.

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,505
So, I'll copy that stuff out, Now,

28
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:27,250
I just have to select this, and now I can do a Pareto chart.

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,710
So, I can do insert, just like we did in the last video.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,130
There's Pareto chart, and there it is.

31
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,280
So, I can see the taste and

32
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,970
the wait staff rude were causing me a lot of problems.

33
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,660
Now, this red line is concentrated in the center of the bar.

34
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,850
You couldn't really see that in the last video.

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:49,110
But, for instance, the taste was 160 our of 470, about 34 or 35%.

36
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,950
So, in the middle of that first bar for taste, we have center, or

37
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,810
we really are hitting 35%.

38
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,810
And then, basically, Excel sort of

39
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,240
draws a smooth curve connecting those percentages at the mid points,

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,010
but we can see taste and the wait staff rude are our big problems.

41
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,390
So, we would concentrate on taste of our food and

42
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,610
also the hiring process or the training of the wait staff.

43
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,240
We wouldn't worry about the saltiness in our food, and

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,640
it looks like people are getting it okay.

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,670
Probably because the taste is bad and the wait staff is rude,

46
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,690
there's no problem getting in.

47
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,360
So, on our next module,

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,230
we're gonna talk about the wonders of probability,

49
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,640
which is really important for understanding data and statistics.
