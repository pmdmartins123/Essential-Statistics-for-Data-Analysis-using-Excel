00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,480
Next, let's talk about the 80/20 Rule or the Pareto principle.

1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,680
The 80/20 Rule means that in any situation 20% of the inputs or

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,750
activities are responsible for 80% of the outcomes or results.

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,810
This is known as the Pareto principle because a man named Pareto

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,940
noticed that 80% wealth was concentrated in 20% of

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,550
the population.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,280
Years later another researcher saw the same phenomenon in quality

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,630
issues where 80% of problems could be traced back to 20% of defects.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,585
Other common examples 80% of revenues are generated by 20% of

9
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:34,174
customers.

10
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:37,541
80% of our quality issues occur with 20% of products.

11
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:42,490
20% of employee are responsible for 80% of sick days.

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,280
This chart illustrates this principle visually.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,200
This is real data that I deal with every day.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,670
In this case, each input on the x axis is an assessment and

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,470
the output on the y axis is the number of people taking

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,750
that assessment over the last year.

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,640
I ordered the results such that assessments with the highest volumes

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,850
are to the left, and those with lower volumes are to the right.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,750
As you can see,

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,740
most of the data clusters to the left of these charts.

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,560
In fact, if you do the math, it turns out that 77% of

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,300
the people taking assessments are taking one of 20.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,730
So even though we have just a little bit more than 100 assessments,

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,250
the vast majority of people are taking one of the top 20.

25
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,050
This pattern repeats across all types of data, organizations, and

26
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,570
circumstances.

27
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,850
Why is this important?

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,500
While the general principle reinforces the idea that things

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,380
are not evenly distributed.

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,740
Not everything contributes equally to the outcome.

31
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,928
Is the relationship always 20, 80/20, no.

32
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:41,370
But the point is that most of something is concentrated

33
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,740
in a few areas.

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,020
In other words understanding where your data is congregated can help

35
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,620
you prioritized action, so you're spending time where it matters most.

36
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,030
A prayer chart will help you do this.

37
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,900
It is a bar graph in which the values are plotted

38
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,160
in decreasing order of relative frequency from left to right.

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,440
Pareto charts are extremely useful for

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,380
analyzing what problems need attention first.

41
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,180
A line graph showing the cumulative relative frequency

42
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,790
is usually super imposed on the bar graph because the values of

43
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,270
the statistical variables are placed in order of relative frequency.

44
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,660
The graph clearly reveals which factors have the greatest impact and

45
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,660
where attention is likely to have the greatest benefit.
