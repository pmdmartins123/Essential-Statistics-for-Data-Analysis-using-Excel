In this lesson, we're gonna talk about the Pareto principle,

1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,390
also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,700
the principle of factor sparsity.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,210
Basically, the Pareto principle states that for

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,260
many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,425
So, here's some examples.

6
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:19,765
20% of the customers generate 80% of the profit.

7
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:23,248
20% of the products may generate 80% of the profit.

8
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:27,280
Most importantly, 20% of the people have 80% of the money.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,705
And very interesting in today's internet age,

10
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:32,370
20% of the websites seem to get 80% of the hits.

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,360
And there's actually a mathematical explanation for that last point.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,130
I'm not sure there is for the others.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,080
So, how can we illustrate the Pareto principle or the 80/20 rule?

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,610
We can create Pareto charts using Excel 2016.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,830
And a Pareto chart, named after the economist Pareto,

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,630
is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph.

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,210
So the individual values of your data are represented in descending

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,960
order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by a line.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,066
And so, in the next video,

20
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:05,060
we'll start teaching you how to make your own Pareto charts.
