0
00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:04,803
Okay, let's suppose you're looking at stock returns, rates of growth or

1
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:07,640
basically growth in revenues for a company.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,470
So let's look at two stocks here.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,660
The first stock every year went up 5%.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,290
The second stock it went down 50%, up 70%, down 50% up 70%.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,980
Which of these stocks is better?

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,660
Well, you might look at the average return.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,720
So you might take the average here, it's gonna be obviously 5%.

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,365
So every year, your money grows by 5%.

9
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:33,132
Now you look at the second stock just topping that average across,

10
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:35,600
the average return is higher than 10%.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,625
So it looks like Stock 2 is better, but the answer is it's not.

12
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,810
Okay, cause the volatility in Stock 2 will eventually kill you.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,420
If you're in Stock 1, your money will always grow.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,670
But in Stock 2, your money will decline.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,810
So what would happen if you start with a dollar in Stock 2.

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,990
Well, the first year you might lose 50%, so you'd be down to $0.50.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:05,340
Then you'd grow by 70%, you'd have 1.7 times what you had here, okay.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,110
Then you'd lose 50%, so you would end up here and

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,340
then you would grow by 70% and you'd end up here.

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,950
That be less money than what you started with.

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,240
If you follow this pattern in four years,

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,950
even though your average return is 10%, you'd have less money.

23
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,100
So you don't wanna say Stock 2 is better.

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,570
So here's where we need the concept of geometric mean,

25
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,660
which leads to CAGRs or compound annual growth rate.

26
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,660
So the geometric mean of n numbers is the nth root

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,340
of the product of those numbers.

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,950
So if I took one, two and four, you multiply those, you get eight.

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:47,339
The cube root of 8 is 2 cuz 2 times 2 times 2 is 8.

30
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:50,779
Now there's a formula or a function in Excel,

31
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:53,700
GEOMEAN which would give you 2 there.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,500
Okay, now so how do you sort of get sort of a typical

33
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,760
annual growth rate for a stock or revenue growth for

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,430
a corporation, given numbers like these.

35
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,950
Okay, and that's called the CAGR, not beer, but

36
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,730
compound annual growth rate.

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,199
But you ask anybody who's been to an MBA program about CAGR,

38
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,924
they may talk about beer, but

39
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:25,840
they'll also talk about compound annual growth rate.

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,238
Okay, so what I did is I took one plus the returns, 1.05, etc.

41
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:35,936
One plus the minus 0.5 is 0.5, 1.7 is the one plus this, etc.

42
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:38,830
Then you take the geometric mean to get the CAGR,

43
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,220
basically our compound annual growth rate.

44
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,390
Basically for each stock and you subtract one.

45
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,910
So you take geometric mean of these four

46
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,488
guys minus one, that's gonna come out to 5%.

47
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,710
It should show you that formula.

48
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,620
We'll widen the column by double-clicking.

49
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,090
Now if I copy that across,

50
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,451
you'll see the second stock has a negative CAGR, negative 8%.

51
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,420
So Stock 2 has a CAGR of minus 8% per year.

52
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,935
Okay, and that makes sense because we saw that if you invest in Stock

53
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:24,110
2, you would decline over time.

54
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,273
And basically, if you would take one plus this CAGR to the fourth power,

55
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:29,991
you'd get this $0.72.

56
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:32,232
If I would take one plus, that's what I mean,

57
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:34,620
it's a compound annual growth rate.

58
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,560
One plus that, carat over the six raises to the fourth power.

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,651
You see those two are exactly the same there.

60
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:44,470
Okay, that's $0.72 you'd have in four years,

61
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,969
if you projected the CAGR four years, you'd have $0.72.

62
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,062
So these CAGRs are really important and

63
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:54,113
the reason they're important again is the volatility.

64
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:57,476
In the long run, volatility will cause you to eventually lose money

65
00:03:57,476 --> 00:03:59,120
if the means are equal.

66
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,610
Okay, if you've got two data sets where the means are equal,

67
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,920
the one with the volatility is gonna have the lower compound

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,570
annual growth rate.

69
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,740
Now in the next lesson, we're gonna start talking about box plots,

70
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,870
which is new to Excel 2016, beautiful box plots.

71
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,820
They give you a fantastic way to quickly compare data sets and

72
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,650
understand the concepts we've been talking about.

73
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,884
Central location spread about the mean and skewness.
