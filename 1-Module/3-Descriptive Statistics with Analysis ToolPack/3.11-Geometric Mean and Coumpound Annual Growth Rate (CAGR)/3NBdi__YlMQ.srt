00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,700
Let's take a look at a different type of mean, the geometric mean.

1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,180
The geometric mean is not a simple average.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,474
It is the nth root of the product of n numbers.

3
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:13,377
That means you multiply your values and then you take the nth root,

4
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:16,970
where n is the number of values you just multiplied.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,640
I know this seems weird and you're probably wondering why you need

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,360
a different type of mean but it is a great, it is really, really great

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,110
when you're comparing two variables with very different properties.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,000
For example, the geometric mean can give you a meaningful

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,880
average to compare companies, that are each rated from 0 to 5 for

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,330
the compensation packages in a scale of 0 to 100 for

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,430
their citizenship efforts.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,470
If you took a simple average of those values,

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,290
you would be over-weighting the citizenship rating.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,680
So, imagine you want to know which company is better then another in

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,580
terms of their compensation and citizenship ratings.

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,820
Company A rated a three for compensation and 75 for

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,340
citizenship while company B has been rated four and 60 respectively.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,110
If you took the simple average of those two ratings you would find

19
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,350
that the company A had higher average at 39 for

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,670
company B added an average of 32.

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,720
However, citizenship ratings are being overweighted in

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,370
the calculation because the range of values is so

23
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,640
dramatically different than those for compensation.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,730
If you calculate a geometric mean,

25
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,290
will you still see that company A has a higher overall rating?

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,040
To do this, we multiply the two values and take the, in this case,

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,370
square root for company A, we get a geometric mean of 15.

28
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,710
For company B, a geometric mean of 15.49.

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,310
A difference.

30
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,790
Another great use of a geometric mean is to calculate your annual

31
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,500
rate of return on an investment.Imagine that

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,245
you invest in a stock that increased by 10% in year one, 15% in year two.

33
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:51,340
20% in year three and then lost 10% in year four.

34
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,860
What would be your average annual return?

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,260
You can't simply take the average 8.75 because

36
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,640
the success of your percentage increases and losses are based on

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
the principle plus the interest earned the previous year.

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,490
So we would take the geometric mean.

39
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,410
To do that, we have to note a couple of things about how you calculate

40
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,720
the geometric mean for percentages.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,210
First this calculation assumes a positive so

42
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,070
negative percentages are subtracted from 1.

43
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,070
And positive percentages are added to one.

44
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,810
As you can see,

45
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,120
if you do the math in this case, your annual return rate is

46
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,710
actually slightly less than what a simple average would have reported.
