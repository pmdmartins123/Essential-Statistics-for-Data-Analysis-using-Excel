0
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,680
In this video, we're gonna show you a couple more really useful

1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,470
Excel statistical functions.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,650
So our data set will be scores, and they could be exam scores or

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,550
golf scores, you'll see the difference.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,798
If it's a test score, a high score is good.

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,410
If it's a golf score, a low score is good.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,770
So here we have the scores, and

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,140
we'll name them like we did in the last video because I think that's

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,120
fairly useful then we don't have to keep pointing to the data.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,690
So if I select the data there, I can go right here and type the word,

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,440
scores.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,405
Okay, so whenever I use the word scores,

12
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,510
it's gonna highlight that data.

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,151
Okay.

14
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,764
So suppose I wanna know the second highest score, okay,

15
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:41,680
we'll exhume their exam scores.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,180
Well, there's a function called the large function.

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,130
So we'll type equal large, and I would type in scores so

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,990
I could use that F3, comma 2 would be the second large score.

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,610
Comma one would be the highest score.

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,920
So I'll show you that formula.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,978
Second highest score was 99.

22
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:05,050
Now what was the second lowest score?

23
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,328
Small function, I'll use that F3 trick.

24
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:13,475
Cisco, sorry not Cisco, we want scores there.

25
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:15,460
It's easier to type scores I think here.

26
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,114
Then the second smallest score was an 80.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,100
Okay.

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,740
Now we wanna know how to rank things in a data set.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,920
So, guess what that function would be?

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,110
Well, something to do with the word rank.

31
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,156
So let's suppose these are exam scores, so the highest exam score,

32
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:34,824
which is a 100, should have a rank of one.

33
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:37,160
Now if they're golf scores, 100 is the worst score.

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,120
That's what I would get for nine holes, the few times I played

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,410
golf and then somebody stole my clubs and that was the end of it.

36
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,370
So if we go here and type in rank, there's a couple of functions.

37
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,630
There's RANK.AVG, RANK.EQ, and RANK.

38
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,170
Now, RANK and RANK.EQ were basically the same.

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,084
And I think Microsoft is trying to phase out rank, so

40
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,681
I guess I'll use RANK.EQ.

41
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:04,665
Now RANK.AVG, will get to what that is in a minute, but I would say

42
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:09,649
RANK.EQ, okay, now basically the number here we wanna rank this

43
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:15,608
score, and then the revis or data, which is again gonna be scores. Okay.

44
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:18,210
Now the important thing comes next.

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,530
See descending or ascending,

46
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,370
zero means descending would mean the highest score gets a rank of 1.

47
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,070
And that's what we want here of these sort of exams.

48
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,080
So I put a 0 there.

49
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,270
Now I can copy that down.

50
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,909
I can double-click the, see the formula here looks like this.

51
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,885
And I can copy that down by double-clicking the left mouse.

52
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:42,690
Double-clicking the left mouse copies a formula or

53
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,700
multiple columns down the matched column to the left.

54
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,925
So if I copy, actually I could copy these both down.

55
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:51,370
Double-click the left mouse, there we go.

56
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,870
So 100 was the best score, and you can see all those formulas,

57
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,840
not that you really need to see them all.

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,884
Now, if they are golf scores, what would we do?

59
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:02,230
We'd change the 0 to a 1, cuz a 100 should be the worst score.

60
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,480
So I would do RANK, okay, .EQ again.

61
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,840
I think I may have, let's widen this column here.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,660
Okay, sometimes you need to deceive this.

63
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,500
So I wanna do a rank, and I wanna rank that score.

64
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,470
Then I'll type Scores.

65
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,120
Now I want a 1 there for ascending.

66
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,060
Okay, so you can see the 100 was the worst score, ranked 59th,

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,860
and then the best score was an 80, which was the worst score here.

68
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,840
Okay, now the thing that's a bit annoying about this but

69
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,210
we can fix it, is then we have ties.

70
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:41,710
Okay.

71
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,560
So see here two people had a 92.

72
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:50,199
And they both get a rank of 24.

73
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,648
Now if you think about that, once you get a rank of 24 and

74
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,800
once you get a rank of 25.

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,330
But Excel has a way to sort of take care of that.

76
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,940
The RANK.AVG, if you had two people tied for 24th you each

77
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,910
give them a rank of 24 and a half, which I think makes more sense.

78
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,159
So let's do that assuming they're exam scores.

79
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,082
So I can type, RANK.AVG.

80
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:23,406
We want the number, is right there.

81
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:31,642
And then I want scores, and then I want 0,

82
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:33,820
highest score would be ascending.

83
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,070
Highest score is a 1.

84
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,720
Okay, so you can see here these two guys got

85
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,530
a rank of 24.5 like I discussed, because of the ties.

86
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,040
If three tied, I guess it would be 21.33, something like that.

87
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,960
But Excel knows to give those tied ranks.

88
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,771
Which I think it makes more sense to see 24.5 twice than two 24s there.

89
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,191
So that concludes our discussion for

90
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:02,770
now of typical Excel statistical functions.

91
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,870
Now, in the next video,

92
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,560
we're gonna talk about something that's very important finance.

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,630
Geometric means and CAGRs.

94
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,170
Not beer but compound annual growth rate.

95
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,170
When you're analyzing stock returns or

96
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,910
rate of growth of revenue you need to understand geometric mean,

97
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,800
and that's what we'll discuss in the next video.
