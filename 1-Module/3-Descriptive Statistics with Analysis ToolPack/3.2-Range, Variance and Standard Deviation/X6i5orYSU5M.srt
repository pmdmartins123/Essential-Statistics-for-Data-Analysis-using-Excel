0
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Now that we know something about

1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,650
central endencies of the values in our data set.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,120
We can calculate the measures of

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,980
variability in other words how spread

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,830
apart the data values are, the range is a

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,240
simple way to express the distribution of the data.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,370
It's calculated by subtracting the minimum value in the set

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,780
from the maximum value.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,120
In this case 10 - 2 which gives us a range of 8.

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,600
The variance is a little more complex

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,310
depending on whether you have a

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,110
population or a sample you can calculate

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,080
the population or sample variance,

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,360
to calculate either you basically sum the

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,340
squared differences between each value

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,739
in the data and the mean and then

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,360
divide by the number of values in the

17
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,640
data set, if you are calculating the

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,410
sample variance however you will

19
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,360
subtract 1 from the number of values in

20
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,790
the data in this case we end up with a

21
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,670
variance of 4.67 if we believe this is a

22
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,829
population of cupcake sales, but I'm

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,290
hoping this is just a sample I want to

24
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,329
keep selling cupcakes. So the sample

25
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,450
variance is 5 are you wondering why you

26
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,340
square the differences before summing

27
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,079
them rather than simply just summing the

28
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,850
difference of each value from the mean,

29
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,670
if you don't square them the sum of the

30
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,639
differences will always be 0, if you want

31
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,859
to understand the variation in your data

32
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,600
we must square those differences so we

33
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,880
don't end up with 0 every time.

34
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,549
The standard deviation is a commonly used

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,319
metric for measuring a unit of

36
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,479
difference from the mean. Variance is

37
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,369
interesting but because we had to square

38
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,889
the differences it is not very easy to

39
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,340
interpret. So to put this estimate back

40
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,380
on the same scale as the mean you must

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,389
take the square root, this is known as

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,789
the standard deviation. The square root

43
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,189
of the sample variance is the sample

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,130
standard deviation which in this example is 2.24

45
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,000
Finally the standard error gives a measure of

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,870
how well a sample represents the population.

47
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,940
it is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the square root

48
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,150
of the number of values in your data.

49
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,150
In this case, we divide our standard deviation 2.24

50
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,950
by the square root of 15 which is 3.87

51
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,759
to produce a standard error of 0.58.
