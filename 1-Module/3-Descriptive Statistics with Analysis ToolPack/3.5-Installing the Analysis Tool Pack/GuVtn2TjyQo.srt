In this video, we're gonna show you how to install the Analysis ToolPak

1
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:09,370
add-in which is useful for a lot of calculations and statistics.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,830
So you may already have this installed.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,380
If you go to the data tab and you see Analysis ToolPak on the right or

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,810
Data Analysis add-in, you've got it.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,280
Now, I uninstalled mine so I can show you how to install.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,650
So all you do is you go to file, you go to options, you go to add-ins.

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,080
Now, don't click on Analysis ToolPak up here,

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,620
a lot of people make that mistake, you click go.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,760
And now there's two Analysis ToolPak add-ins here,

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,875
Analysis ToolPak, Analysis ToolPak- VBA.

11
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:46,520
Don't worry about the VBA, just check Analysis ToolPak, click OK,

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,760
now if I go to data, you'll see Data Analysis and that's what we need.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,070
Now, what happens to my students a lot is they've done this procedure

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,100
perfectly and it happens to me, and the Data Analysis add-in disappears.

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,880
Even though it's checked when you go add-ins.

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,400
Then what should you do?

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,160
You should uncheck it, okay, and

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,310
then reinstall it, that always seems to work and I have no clue why.

19
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,290
So in the next video,

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,280
we'll use this Data Analysis add-in to get descriptive statistics for

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,610
GM and Cisco monthly stock returns in the 1990s.
