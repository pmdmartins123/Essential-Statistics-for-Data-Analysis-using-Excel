00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,160
Wayne mentioned skewness earlier, and showed some example.

1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,680
Let's take a closer look at skewness in terms of mean, median and mode.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,100
Data can be normally distributed, the shape of a normal distribution

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,610
is often called bell-shaped, because the data

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,710
is distributed symmetrically around the mid-point of the data.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,790
In such distributions, the mean, median,

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,280
and mode are clustered together.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,910
Some histograms will show a skewed distribution to the right.

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,790
A skewed distribution to the right is said to be positively skewed.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,260
In this kind of distribution, you have a large number of occurrences

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,010
on the left side of the chart and

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,630
a fewer, in the upper values, on the right side.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,780
So the tail, goes to the right, that's a right skew.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,285
In some histograms, will show a skewed distribution, to the left.

14
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:48,910
A distribution skewed to the left is said to be negatively skewed.

15
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,660
This kind of distribution has a large number of occurrences,

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,860
in the upper values,or the right side, and

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,170
a lower, a fewer, values in the lower or the left side.

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,130
The distribution of the mode is greater than the mean and

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,650
the median.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,310
Now we can also look at some other shapes the distributions can take.

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,710
For example some distributions may be bi-modal,

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,810
meaning it has two peaks.

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,840
This shape makes sure that the data is being affected by two different

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,750
sources.

25
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,110
If this shape occurs,

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,598
the two sources should be analyzed separately.

27
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,590
In a bi-modal distribution, the min and

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,700
median may actually cluster together and you might assume

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,185
the distribution is normal if you don't plot the data histogram.

30
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:33,030
Although measure of central tendency are important in understanding

31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,350
your data, sometimes visually inspecting it,

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,750
can also provide you good insight.

33
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,200
Our uniform distributions shows little variation across your bins or

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,290
categories.

35
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,010
This type of distribution could occur because you have combined

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,630
the sources of variation in your visualization, or

37
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,580
because you're bins are too small, or too large.

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,290
Change the way you are creating your histogram can provide

39
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,870
more information about the actual distribution of your data.

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,180
Finally, a distribution might be random,

41
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,470
which means it has no apparent pattern.

42
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,740
It may describe a distribution that has several modes or peaks,

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,690
it could occur for the same reasons a uniform distribution does, similar

44
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,920
changes might provide more insight into the distribution of your data.

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,880
Finally histograms are valuable tools because they

46
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,700
allow us to better understand the shape or distribution of our data.

47
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,570
In general we want our data to be normally distributed.

48
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,430
When it's not,

49
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,540
it's what we call skewed with data clustered at one end or the other.

50
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,560
If our data are normally distributed we know

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,555
that 68% of the data fell within one plus one minus one standard

52
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:39,295
deviations of the mean 95% within two standard deviations and

53
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:44,150
99% within three and as I mentioned, most statistics assume normality.

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,088
If not normal although we can run the statistic results that we would

55
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:52,109
get will be uninterpretable or worse lead to the wrong conclusions.
