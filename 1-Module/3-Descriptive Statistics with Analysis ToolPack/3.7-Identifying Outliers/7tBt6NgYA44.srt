00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,813
Now that we have a little better understanding of central tendency,

1
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:05,817
measures of variability, and the shape of our data,

2
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:07,302
let&#39;s take a closer look at outliers.

3
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:10,757
Outliers are often identified through a visual inspection of our

4
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:13,411
data, which is why it&#39;s so important to plot it.

5
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:17,215
You may be wondering if there&#39;s a mathematical way to calculate

6
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:17,950
outliers.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,435
Well, it shouldn&#39;t surprise you that there is.

8
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:23,760
Outliers are mathematically defined as being greater

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,210
than 1.5 times the interquartile range.

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,320
To calculate the interquartile range for your data, place your

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,250
data in numerical order and identify the first and third quartile.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,510
In other words, at point at which 25% of the data are below, and

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,790
at which point 25% of the data are above.

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,300
The first represents the upper bound of what we call the lower, or first,

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,190
quartile.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,426
The latter represents the lower bound of the upper, or

17
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:48,305
fourth, quartile.

18
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:53,890
The IQR is simply the difference between those values.

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:59,290
Multiply that range by 1.5, add this value to the third quartile.

20
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,360
Any number greater than that would be a suspected outlier.

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,590
Subtract it from the first quartile, and

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,370
any number less than that is a suspected outlier.

23
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,980
So let&#39;s take a look at an example.

24
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,800
Suppose we have the following set of data, and it looks like this.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,920
So the question is, is 14 an outlier?

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,110
There are 15 values in this dataset.

27
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,900
To find the first quartile, we need to divide 15 by 4,

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,000
which is 3.75, so we count over 3.75 values from the left in the dataset.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,290
The lower quartile is anything lower than 4.

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,860
To find the upper quartile, we count 3.75 values over from the right.

31
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,490
The upper quartile is anything over 7.

32
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:46,210
To calculate the interquartile range, Q3-Q1, 7-4 = 3.

33
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,280
Now we multiply 1.5 by 3, we get 4.5.

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,130
Outliers on the low end would be anything less than -0.5.

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,541
Outliers on the upper end would be anything greater than 11.5.

36
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,941
So 14 is an outlier.
