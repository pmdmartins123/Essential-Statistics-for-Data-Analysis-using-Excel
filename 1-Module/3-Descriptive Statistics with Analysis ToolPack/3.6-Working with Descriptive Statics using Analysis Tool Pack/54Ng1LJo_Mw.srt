0
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,190
Now that we've installed the Analysis Toolpak, or

1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,200
the data analysis add-in, let's use it to analyze monthly

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,250
returns in the 1990s on GM and Cisco.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,860
There are some other stocks here, but we'll just focus on GM and

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,100
Cisco here.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,960
Okay, so we go data, data analysis,

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,280
which we now see cuz we installed it.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,810
And then there's plenty of options here but what we really care about

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,370
is Descriptive Statistics, which is right here.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,540
We'll be using a bunch more of these things later in the course, okay, so

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,570
now we gotta fill in this dialog box.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,290
So the Input Range is our data and I'd like to include the labels, so

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,880
I'll start here with GM.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,620
I do Ctrl+Shift+Right Arrow to go to the right, down right go to

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,110
the bottom, that picks off my datam, the data is in columns.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,340
Output range is the upper left hand corner of where I want excel to put

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,920
its statistics, I can just say right here.

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,300
Let's say, I6, then you have to check summary statistics or

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,900
you won't get any, so you click okay.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,693
You'll get summary statistics,

20
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:06,298
okay, now we might make that a little bit bigger.

21
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:11,140
Bold face it, okay.

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,910
So now what we want to do is really compare GM and

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,370
Cisco on three dimensions.

24
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,620
Remember we said, typical value.

25
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,100
Now, question would be mean or median or mode here.

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,210
Okay, so the mean is right here.

27
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,300
So, GM average about 1% a month returns, CSCO about 5.5% and

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,620
media which you know, half the data is below it, half the data is above

29
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,730
it, GM's median was actually slightly negative.

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,490
Cisco's median was 5% which is fairly positive.

31
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,990
There is no mode, remember that mode is most frequently occurring value.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,300
Again, let me highlight basically, let's say in yellow, what we use for

33
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,000
typical value.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,570
So there's no mode for GM and the reason for

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,950
that is because no, return on GM occurred more than once.

36
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,970
And for CISCO the most recurring value is 5.1% we dont

37
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,810
use that too much.

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,230
But the question is, for

39
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,770
typical value should I use the Mean or the Median.

40
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,640
And it depends on Skewness as it turns out.

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,110
If you have lots of Skewness and

42
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,540
there's a measure of Skewness on the output.

43
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,530
There's a skewness value here, okay.

44
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,190
And we'll define what we mean by lots of skewness in a minute, okay.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,760
If have lots of skewness and

46
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,180
basically that generally means that skewness measure

47
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,210
if it's greater than +1 it means it's very positive we skew the data.

48
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,970
Or the skewness is less than minus one.

49
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,120
If you have a lot of skewness,

50
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,100
we'll have a great example of this in a minute,

51
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,990
you should use the median.

52
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,720
Because basically what happens is the extreme values basically distort

53
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,750
the typical value.

54
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,380
If you look at income that's a very good example where there's a lot of

55
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,630
skewness.

56
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,260
If somebody has an income of a hundred million dollars a year in

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,630
a small town, they would greatly raise the mean.

58
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,750
We'll see example of this in a minute but

59
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,700
they really wouldn't do much to the median and

60
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,780
there $100 million a year is not really the typical person, okay.

61
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,732
So we look here we don't have much skewness we would use the mean for

62
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:25,291
typical value, So

63
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:29,959
Cisco does better than GM typically, higher mean.

64
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,933
Now what about spread about the mean,

65
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,540
which doc has more spread about the mean?

66
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,320
Well, we learned a couple of videos ago you look at the standard

67
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,640
deviation and the variance.

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,155
And so the standard deviation is what we usually like to use,

69
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,010
it's the square root the variance.

70
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,950
You really need the variance to get to the standard deviation,

71
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,650
but once you have the standard deviation that's enough.

72
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,907
So, standard deviation on Cisco is 12.2% on the monthly returns,

73
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:05,250
on GM it's about 9%, so there's more spread about the mean for Cisco.

74
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,842
And then there's not much skewness,

75
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:15,414
these numbers are very close to zero, again greater and

76
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:19,690
plus one is possibly skew, minus one is negatively skewed.

77
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,180
So basically not much skewness and

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,796
we saw that in the histograms that we had for GM and sysco.

79
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:32,070
Fairly symmetric data sets.

80
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,570
Now a more powerful example of why you don't always want to use

81
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,150
the mean for

82
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,940
typical value, though people like to do this is based on real situation.

83
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,600
Let’s talk about 1984 and this really happen, if you are basketball

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,570
fan you may think about his and even if you are not a U-S

85
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,580
citizen I think the person I’m talking about you heard of.

86
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,680
Because he was one of the most recognizable people in the world,

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,420
okay so let’s look at 1984 University of North Carolina,

88
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,080
a great school.

89
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,900
Geography majors had the highest average salary, this is true.

90
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,000
A friend of mine told me, at the University of North Carolina, okay.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,990
So should everybody have wanted to be a geography major?

92
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,990
So let's suppose there were 15 geography majors,

93
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,030
who average $40,000 who got made $40,000, and one made $1 million.

94
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,930
This isn't that far from the truth.

95
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,521
Now if you look at the median, you know that's gonna be the midpoint

96
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:26,780
between the eighth and ninth largest salary, that's gonna be 40,000.

97
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,960
That's a much better measure of the typical income of the geography

98
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,540
major than if I average these numbers, I mean we'll skip ahead.

99
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,200
There's a function average which we'll learn about later, but

100
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,190
I think most of you know that one.

101
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,450
What was the average salary for geography majors?

102
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,910
$100,000 and it's indeed true the highest average salary for

103
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,090
1984 geography majors at UNC.

104
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,230
The highest starting salary majors in any

105
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,740
academic major at UNC was geography majors.

106
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,950
So should everybody have been a geography major?

107
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,850
But the median salary was surely higher for let's say,

108
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,040
accounting mayors or computer science mayors.

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,420
What was going on?

110
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,800
Michael Jordan was a geography mayor.

111
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,780
As we know we can't all be like Mike,

112
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,880
I mean that's probably a slogan.

113
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,050
Basically we should've been looked at the mean salary of geography

114
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,940
majors, we should've the mediator, the typical value.

115
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,900
Basically here is a great example,

116
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,880
there would be a lot of scewness against skipping ahead of it.

117
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,075
There is an Excel function that measures skewness and

118
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:31,057
if you would look at the skewness of this dataset,

119
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,473
you get a skewness of four which is much bigger than +1.

120
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:38,077
So our roll would tell you to use the median income to measure

121
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:41,757
basically atypical value for UNC Geography Majors income,

122
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:44,000
rather than the mean.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,630
Now in the next video will show how you can take the mean for

124
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,880
a data set and the standard deviation, put them together and try

125
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,630
to understand the typical range for a data set, which is very important.

126
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,320
And also spot unusual data points know as highlighters.
