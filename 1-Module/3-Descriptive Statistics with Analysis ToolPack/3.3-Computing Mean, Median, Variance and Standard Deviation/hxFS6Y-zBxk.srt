0
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,990
So now that we know how to create histograms, we want to learn how to

1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,310
basically create numerical measures that can summarize the data set.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,480
So what are the three dimensions on which we might want to summarize

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,046
a data set.

4
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:15,300
A typical value, what's a typical value for a data set?

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,840
Spread about the typical value, how spread out is the data?

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,460
Is it concentrated towards the typical value, or

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,370
does it really very a lot?

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,560
And then skewness which we talked about, positively skewed,

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,930
negatively skewed or symmetric.

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,900
So lets deuce a brief demo without really using excel function or

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,060
excel capabilities of what we mean by calculating a typical values,

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,160
spread about the typical value Skewness.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,890
The formula's complex so we won't worry about that.

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,720
But here we have a simple data set.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,550
We've got the numbers, 1, 3 and 5.

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,760
And so for a typical value, we have sort of two measurers.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,995
We have the average, which you know what that is,

18
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:58,545
you add up the numbers.

19
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:01,440
And divide by how many?

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,520
So the average here if I have one, three and

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,940
five, you add those up you get nine.

22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,300
You divide by three, you get three, okay.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,320
Then we sometimes use the median, as you'll see later, for

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,630
a typical value.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,800
The median is sort of the man in the middle,

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,879
the data point in the middle.

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,250
Now that can be a lot tricky.

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,770
So if have one three and five ordered from smallest to largest

29
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,290
three is in the middle, there is one data point below it and

30
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,210
one above it, so the median would be three.

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,540
Okay but let's look at the second data set the are four data points so

32
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,280
which one is in the middle?

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,510
The second one has 1 data point below it and

34
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,880
the second data point is 2 above it so it's not in the middle.

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,360
The third data point has 1 data point above it, 2 below it so

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,720
it's not in the middle.

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,790
So we have an even number data points,

38
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,820
basically we average the two middle ones.

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,117
Okay so for set 2, the median is 3.5.

40
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:07,019
Now there's a third measure, the mode, the most frequently occurring

41
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,806
value, but that's pretty easy to do, we usually use Excel for that.

42
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:16,200
And that's really not usually what we use to summarize the data set.

43
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:20,090
Okay, now what about spread about the mean this is

44
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,910
incredibly important.

45
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,580
So, basically spread about the mean, the measure we usually use,

46
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,800
measures we usually use are variance of standard deviation.

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,920
So, variances average square deviation from the mean,

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,890
if we use XBAR for the mean and Xi for the observation, we take every

49
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,050
data point minus the mean squared, add those up, and divide.

50
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,210
You would think, you would divide by the number of data points, but

51
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,050
you divide by one less.

52
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,890
That's a bit complicated to explain but

53
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,030
we'll probably address that in module four, okay.

54
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,220
But why do you square the deviations from the mean,

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,910
why not just add them up?

56
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,430
Well you can show if you're good at algebra for any data set if you take

57
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,170
every data point minus the mean and add them up You'll always get zero.

58
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,100
You have to square the deviations from the mean so that basically

59
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,820
the positive and negative deviations don't cancel out, and

60
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,830
then the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

61
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,840
So for the data set 1, 3, and 5, let's go through the calculations.

62
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,430
Let's get the variance, so

63
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,810
you would take every data point, the mean is 3, we know that.

64
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,364
So you take the first data point minus the mean, caret mean squared,

65
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:28,806
then you take the second data point.

66
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:33,384
Minus the mean squared.

67
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,738
Then you take the third data point, 5 minus the mean squared,

68
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:45,183
notice those all be positive to be square -2 or when you,

69
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,922
that should be -3 there, sorry.

70
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:54,130
Now that's the sum of the squared deviations, you divide that by 2.

71
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,239
3-1 cuz there is three data points.

72
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,325
Okay, see a -2 squared that's 4,

73
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:09,940
3- 3 squared is 0, 5- 3 squared is 4, 4 + 4 / 2.

74
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,039
See if 8/2 which is 4, so there is your variance.

75
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,939
And then the standard deviation would be

76
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:26,060
the square root of four, which is two.

77
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,230
Now, basically if you know the variance,

78
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,610
you know the standard deviation, so which one do we use more often?

79
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,220
Okay, basically we use the standard deviation

80
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,370
Is used more often as a measure of spread about the typical value.

81
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,013
And the reason for that is,

82
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:46,764
the standard deviation has the same units as the data.

83
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:53,219
So if our data is money, it's measured in dollars or euros, I

84
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:58,160
don't know what a dollar squared is, and that's the units of variance.

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,930
But I do know what a dollar is, okay?

86
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,410
So that's why we often use standard deviation

87
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,940
instead of variance as a measure of spread about the mean.

88
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,960
Now, in our next video,

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,240
we're going to show you how to install the great analysis tool

90
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,170
pack add into Excel 2016, cuz we can use that to get a lot of

91
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,350
these descriptive statistics that we use to describe a data set.
