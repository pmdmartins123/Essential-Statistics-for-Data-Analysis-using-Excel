Let's take a closer look at Descriptive Statistics.

1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,879
Descriptive Statistics do exactly that,

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,069
they describe your data. Specifically its

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,070
most common values dispersion and distribution.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,490
Here's a list of values which may represent something like say

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,650
hourly sales of cupcakes,

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,230
Descriptive Statistics includes measures

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,359
of central tendency the most common of

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,390
which is the mean or average.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,350
We can calculate the Population Mean

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,599
represented by the Greek symbol mu or

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,460
the Sample Mean which is represented by x-bar.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,279
The equation for calculating the

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,200
population or Sample Mean essentially

14
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,180
says to sum all of the values for that

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,100
variable and then divide by the number

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,290
of values that we have. In this case we

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,300
sum the individual values related to

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,059
cupcake sales and obtain a total of 90

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,860
and then divide by the number of values

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,090
15 to produce a mean of 6. Another way

21
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,219
another measure of central tendency is

22
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,530
to calculate the median which represents

23
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,420
the middle value in the data set.

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,489
To find the position of the middle value

25
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,280
in a sorted list add 1 to the length of

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,930
the list and divide by 2, here we have 15 values.

27
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,300
We will add 1 to make 16 and divide by 2 to get a result of 8.

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,560
This tells us that the median value is the

29
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,170
8th value in the sorted list which is 6

30
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,170
the same as the Mean. The mode is even

31
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,390
easier to calculate, it's simply the most

32
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,650
frequently occurring value in the dataset.

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,150
In this case the mode is 6, for a normal distribution of values

34
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,020
the mean, median and mode around the same value.

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,530
Now let's look at those same

36
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,750
statistics for a data set that doesn't

37
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,509
have a normal distribution, here's a list

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,329
of daily leaflet handout counts again

39
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,909
we'll start with the Sample Mean, we sum

40
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,860
the values in our data and then divide

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,560
by the number of values. Here the sum of

42
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,740
our values is 108 and then we divide by

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,680
the number of values which is 16 to produce a mean of 6.75.

44
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,810
Now to find the median which represents the

45
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,969
middle value in the data set we add 1 to

46
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,430
the length of the list and divide by 2

47
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,789
in this case we have 16 values, we add 1

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,459
which is 17 divided by 2 and we find

49
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,140
that the median would be in the

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,200
position 8.5 in a sorted list.

51
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,750
This us that the median value is halfway

52
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,360
between the eighth and ninth values in

53
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,610
that sorted list. In this list those values are 6 and 7.

54
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,450
So the median is halfway between 6 and 7 or 6.5

55
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,610
and the mode the most frequently occurring

56
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:38,060
value in the data set, in this case the mode is 5.
