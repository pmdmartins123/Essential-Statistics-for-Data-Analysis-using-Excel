0
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,620
So we've been using the analysis tool backer, the data analysis add

1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,770
in that you see here to get these descriptive statistics.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,740
But Excel has built in many great statistical functions that you can

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,335
use to basically get the same information.

4
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:16,405
So I'd like to show you how these functions works,

5
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:17,365
because you may prefer them.

6
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:20,515
Now, if we're going to refer to data often,

7
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:22,965
it often helps to name the data.

8
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:26,815
So, in other words, here is our Cisco data right here.

9
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:29,615
So if I want to color that right there,

10
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:31,225
wouldn't it be nice if I could just name that?

11
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:32,775
And then I don't have to keep pointing to it,

12
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:35,650
I could actually just type the name of the data in there.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,490
There is a shortcut using the F3 key to paste the range name in.

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,170
So, if I select this range of my data, and

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,278
I can go to this name box here and I can type let's say, Cisco

16
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:54,810
right there and hit enter, now I have named that data Cisco.

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,720
So if I go to that name box here and

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,790
I type Click on Cisco, it highlights the data.

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,588
So basically, I could of course point to this data all the time, but

20
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,855
if I'm somewhere else in the workbook,

21
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:09,922
then basically it'll be nice to just use the name, and

22
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:12,608
the F3 key let's you paste a name in a formula.

23
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:17,550
And this is very useful.

24
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,160
So let's really duplicate with Excel functions what we got

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,390
from the analysis tool pack.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,580
Okay, so how would I get the mean for Cisco?

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,900
I could use average as the function, now I could

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,620
actually just type the word Cisco, I mean Excel would autocomplete that.

29
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,120
It understands the range frame so I can use that F3 trick or

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,650
just point to the data.

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,350
But I'll average Cisco there, okay, now this is a null thing,

32
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,350
Excel thinks it's a date.

33
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,100
Okay, so I'm gonna format all these things to be a couple of decimal

34
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,450
points, Ctrl+1 brings up Format Cells, and

35
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,720
I can make these all be let's say, four decimal points.

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,700
Okay, so you can see that matches exactly what I have there.

37
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,020
Now a neat feature starting Excel 2013 is I can show you the formulas

38
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,620
with formula text.

39
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,460
If I click FORMULATEXT you're basically gonna

40
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,590
see the formula there, okay.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,240
Now what about the median,

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,420
there is a function called MEDIAN that gives you the median.

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,450
And I can hit F3 now, and the F3 key, see, there's Cisco.

44
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,445
I can paste that name in there, see it highlights the data in blue,

45
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:33,020
and I can just copy that formula text down here.

46
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,430
Now the mode.

47
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,470
There are bunch of mode function cuz mode is most frequently

48
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,540
occurring value, there could be more than one mode.

49
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,140
I don't want to get into that or readings and the data

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,010
analysis could talk about that, but let's just use the mode function.

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,470
So there's a couple of them here it's just

52
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,280
not worth the complications.

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,393
But I'd say mode and basically I should, mode of Cisco or

54
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:02,289
I can use that F3 track, and see that matches what we've got here.

55
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:10,495
Standard deviation, the function is stdev, this time I'll use F3,

56
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:15,660
paste in Cisco, and I'm not sure which is easier, F3 or typing it.

57
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:25,600
That's 12.2%, and the variants use VAR function, I'll type Cisco.

58
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,340
That matches what we have here.

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,360
Now I'll talk about kurtosis briefly, it's not too important.

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,610
Sounds like a fatal disease, she has kurtosis,

61
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,600
she has three months to live.

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,810
But skewness, there's a function skew, and

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,610
I'll do Cisco and that matches the skewness.

64
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,690
By the way, if you type in a function in Excel,

65
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,745
go to the Function wizard and you wanna know more,

66
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:55,245
you can click on help, and you can see the ugly skewness formula.

67
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:57,195
But I don't think we really need to know it,

68
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,095
there is the ugly skewness formula.

69
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:01,365
We just need to know what it does, okay.

70
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:03,504
So then I could do formula text again here.

71
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:10,450
And kurtosis basically measures The shape of the histogram,

72
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,460
whether it looks like a bell curve, and when it's near 0.

73
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,650
The kurtosis means that it looks like a bell curve,

74
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,850
when it's not near zero, it doesn't look like a bell curve.

75
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,450
This can be important when you're looking at stock returns,

76
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,790
to see if they have what's called fat tails.

77
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,140
They are spread out more than the bell curve, but

78
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,960
just to show you there is a function for this.

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,470
Although, nothing that we're gonna give you for

80
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,270
homework or exams will involve this.

81
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,610
But basically you should know these functions available here of enhanced

82
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,250
Kurt Jock, that are jock at, that would be important.

83
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,370
Okay, now we've got a couple more functions we wanna show you here,

84
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,420
before we go on to the next video which we'll deal with some more

85
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,120
Excel statistical functions in a different file.

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,590
But often we wanna know percent dollars of a dataset so

87
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,470
the ninetieth percent on Cisco, what does that mean?

88
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:08,130
That means 9 out of 10 months below that, 1 in 10 above that.

89
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,770
The 10th percent all means 1 and 10 below, 9 and 10 above.

90
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,110
So there's a couple of functions that do this.

91
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:21,330
So I type in percent, there's a PERCENTILE.EXC and PERCENTILE.INC.

92
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,570
Now, the book explains the difference between these

93
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,000
it's pretty complicated.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,010
But the .exe I think is considered a better one.

95
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,750
Microsoft added this I think in 2015.

96
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,350
So we'll use that.

97
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,930
And so then I would basically type in the range name, which is CSCO,

98
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,330
and that I want the 90th percentile.

99
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,100
I type in 0.9, so roughly this should be a pretty

100
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,890
good return of nine out of ten months or worse.

101
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,390
And one out of ten months or above that.

102
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,895
21% return, one out of ten months roughly CISCO does better than

103
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:59,610
20.6%, nine out of ten months CISCO does worst than 20.6%.

104
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,530
Now, sometimes we wanna know where our data point ranks in a data set,

105
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,360
basically represented.

106
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,656
I look at row 1 53, no reason but it was a bad month.

107
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:15,860
Cisco loss 14%, so the question is where does that row rank?

108
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,474
Probably pretty badly as a percentile, so

109
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:22,247
there is a percent rank function, okay not to be confused with

110
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:26,620
percentile function let me just show you again the formula text there.

111
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:34,455
Okay, so we wanna know where August 1998 ranked,

112
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:40,060
I can do percent rank, PERCENTRANK.EXC( I prefer.

113
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,230
Okay, now the array is again Cisco.

114
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,030
And F 153 was the value.

115
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,020
The significance has no significance.

116
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,396
It's how many decimal points you want, really not very important.

117
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:52,146
Okay, so

118
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:57,610
basically 4.5% of the months roughly were worse than August 1998.

119
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,560
So it was indeed a bad month.

120
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,850
Now people sometimes get confused by percentile, percent, and rank.

121
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,668
So basically what you should know is percentile returns

122
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:13,774
a value from the dataset, like a stock return.

123
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:23,490
Percent rank, returns in a sense a probability.

124
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,230
Or it serves a four and a half percent chance that basically

125
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,620
a month would be worse than that, minus 14 percent.

126
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,690
But the percentile returns a value of the data set which I can make

127
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,390
a percentage if I do Ctrl+1, I can make that into a percentage.

128
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,321
Now, in the next video we are going to show you a couple of more

129
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:45,673
Excel functions that can be very useful to you when you analyze data.
