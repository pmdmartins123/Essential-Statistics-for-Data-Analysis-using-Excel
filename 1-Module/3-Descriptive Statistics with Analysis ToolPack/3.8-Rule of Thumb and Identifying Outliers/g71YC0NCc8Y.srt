00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,040
For any data set it's really important to understand

1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,120
the normal range of variation.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,500
The great American statistician, Edward Demings,

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,560
who helped Japan after World War II, come back from

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,520
their defeat to become a manufacturing power, really harped

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,020
on the importance of understanding normal variation with a data set.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,640
So we're gonna use the rule of thumb here to understand normal variation

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,410
for a data set.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,244
And basically the rule of thumb says in most data sets 95% of your data

9
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:36,286
is within two standard deviations of the mean.

10
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:42,535
And the 95% comes from the normal random variable,

11
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:44,386
you'll see why in module three.

12
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:51,130
Okay, and anything more than two standard deviations from the mean

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,500
is called an outlier or unusual data point.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,570
And we'll highlight the outliers for Cisco, we'll focus on Cisco here.

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,022
Okay, so basically let's find the range of normal variation.

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,645
I'll actually give you sports example on this too, but

17
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:09,350
it's really important.

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,690
We'll give an example on sports and

19
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,480
IQs cuz this is such an important topic.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,220
So for Cisco what is normal variation?

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,676
Okay, you would take the mean for

22
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:24,081
Cisco right there minus two times the standard deviation.

23
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,175
That's about -19%.

24
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:32,290
Then you would take the mean plus two standard deviations.

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,100
So normal variation for Cisco and

26
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,100
it's almost always a wider range than people think.

27
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,710
Normal variation for Cisco monthly return on stock in

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,720
the 1990s was -19% to 30%, okay.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,811
And so if you saw a month for Cisco went up 25%,

30
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:49,141
well that's fairly typical.

31
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:51,559
Down 15% fairly typical.

32
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:55,380
Up 35%, not so typical.

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,430
So, another example, let's look at IQs which we've discussed.

34
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,230
So the mean for IQs, I guess it doesn't want to capitalize

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,040
is 100 and the standard deviation is 15.

36
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,432
So if we go within two standard deviations to the mean,

37
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:17,933
two standard deviations below that would be 100 minus 30, 70 and

38
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:20,465
two standard deviations above 130.

39
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:26,220
70 to 130 should have 95% of all people's IQs.

40
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,250
And that's exactly true, cuz IQs are symmetric.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,210
And then an outlier would be an IQ above 130 or below 70.

42
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,120
Now, one other example on this.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's take football point spreads, which is a prediction by Las Vegas

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,910
of how many points a team will win a football game, the pro football.

45
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,430
The mean for a football game would be the Las Vegas

46
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,890
prediction that's pretty close.

47
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,076
Now every year if you take the standard deviation of the scores of

48
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:03,322
football games about the point spread you get about 14 points.

49
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:10,438
So if you look at a football game, like last year's Superbowl,

50
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:13,468
Carolina Panthers were favored by, let's say 5.

51
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:17,180
The Las Vegas people thought they'd win by 5.

52
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,220
So if you go double that standard deviation in either direction,

53
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,372
28 points in either direction, what would be a normal outcome for

54
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,386
that football game?

55
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:28,264
Carolina winning by 28, more than 5, 33.

56
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:31,530
They were playing Denver, who actually won.

57
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,770
Go 28 points below that, you go Denver by 23,

58
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,590
and that would be a normal range of variation.

59
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,150
Now Denver won, and that was considered a big upset.

60
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,490
But they didn't win by 23, so that was not an outlier.

61
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,185
So to conclude this video, let's show you how to highlight outliers.

62
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:53,002
Notice we have the lower limit here and we have the upper limit here.

63
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:56,264
So we wanna highlight stuff.

64
00:03:56,264 --> 00:04:00,440
In Excel, there's a feature called conditional formatting which we're

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,162
not gonna do in total detail but

66
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:05,889
we can do highlight cells greater than a value or less than a value.

67
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:10,111
So if you would say anything that's greater than this value, we

68
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:14,489
can highlight in one color anything that's less than its value and

69
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,740
another color and that highlights our outlier.

70
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,530
So we first select our data,

71
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,350
control shift down arrow, we go home, conditional formatting.

72
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,814
And so we're gonna go highlight cells, we're gonna do greater than,

73
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:31,107
and I can just point I think to that value there.

74
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:35,980
We can make that red.

75
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,900
So everything above 29% is red.

76
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,755
And I can do home, conditional formatting, top-bottom rules,

77
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:48,224
sorry, highlight cells, less than okay, and

78
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:50,924
then I can point to this number here.

79
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:56,750
I should probably change the color, let's say green, doesn't matter.

80
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,830
So then I can see all the really good months were highlighted in red

81
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,160
that were outliers, that were unusual, and

82
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,240
all the bad months are highlighted in green.

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,340
There's one right there.

84
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,490
Okay, now in our next video we're gonna learn different ways to get

85
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,350
these statistics we got with the analysis tool pack.

86
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,300
There are Excel functions that will help you get these statistics, and

87
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,670
we're gonna show you how to do that in the next video.
