00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Another way to visualize data is by using a box plot or a box and

1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,153
whisker plot.

2
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:09,940
Box plots split the data set into quartiles.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,330
The body of the box plot consists of a box, hence the name,

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,120
which goes from the first quartile to the third quartile,

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,670
visually showing you the range of the middle 50% of your data.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,804
Remember the inner quartile range that we mentioned when we discussed

7
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:23,360
outliers?

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,810
This box represents that range.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,690
Within the box, a vertical line is drawn at q2,

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,390
the middle quartile, and this is the median of the data set.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,040
Sometimes these plots also include a star or

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,270
something similar to indicate the mean of a data set.

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,400
Two horizontal lines called whiskers extend from the top and

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,830
bottom of the box.

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,335
The bottom whisker goes from the bottom of the box to the smallest

16
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:50,370
non-outlier in the data set and

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,200
represents the first quartile of the data.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,700
In other words,

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,410
it shows the range in which the first 25% of your data fall.

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,915
The top whisker goes from the top of the box to the largest

21
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:05,626
non-outlier showing where the last 25% of your data fall.

22
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:09,570
In the data set typically includes one or more outliers,

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,490
they're defined as one point times the upper and lower quartile value.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,300
They are plotted separately as points on the chart.

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,230
The third quartile is the top part of the box,

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,530
the second quartile is the bottom part of the box.

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,650
Thus, box plot show you the range of your data,

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,080
as well as within each quartile.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,600
In addition, they can also review any skewness patterns in your data.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,520
If most of the observations are concentrated on the low

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,320
end of the scale, the distribution is skewed right.

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,130
And if the observations are concentrated on the upper end,

33
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,120
the distribution is skewed left.

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,750
If the distribution is symmetric,

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,440
the observations will be evenly split at the median.
