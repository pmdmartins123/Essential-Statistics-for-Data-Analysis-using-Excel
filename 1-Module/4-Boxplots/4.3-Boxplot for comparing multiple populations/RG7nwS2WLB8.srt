00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,970
If you recall in lesson three,

1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,340
we spent a lot of time comparing monthly returns on GM and Cisco.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,390
We did it with a histogram, we did it with descriptive statistics.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,920
We'll see a box plot really,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,810
I think more easily summarizes the differences and

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,510
similarities between the monthly returns on Cisco and GM.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,310
Now, ideally you would like to have the GM returns in one column and

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,860
the Cisco returns in another column, like we did in lesson three, but

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,770
Microsoft's box plot capabilities doesn't support that at present.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,190
So what I had to do is put the GM returns in one column, and

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,910
then the Cisco returns right below that.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,340
So, you have to set things up like that,

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,640
not have your data in multiple columns in this situation.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,920
So now we can create a box plot for GM and Cisco with the data set up

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
like this by going Ctrl+Shift+Right arrow+Down arrow.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
Then again, we'll pick up box and whisker plot.

16
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:57,160
There we go.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,005
And again, from the Design tab, I like to make it black.

18
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:04,711
Okay, now what do we learn from this here?

19
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:06,870
Okay, what can we learn about GM and Cisco?

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,620
We've already learned a lot of stuff.

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,470
That Cisco does better on average.

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,934
How do you see that?

23
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:16,165
Typically than GM, because the upper whisker for Cisco is higher, and

24
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:18,280
the box for Cisco is higher.

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,390
So for typical value,

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,420
it's easy to see visually that Cisco did better than GM.

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,400
Okay.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,150
Now, basically we had symmetry for both Cisco and GM.

29
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,550
And how can we sort of see that?

30
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,780
Well, basically, the height of the top whisker and

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,580
the bottom whisker are roughly the same.

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,910
So we don't have much skewness, okay.

33
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,450
If the top whisker was much bigger than the bottom whisker,

34
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,270
you'd have a lot of skewness.

35
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,172
Okay?

36
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:46,506
If the bottom whisker was much bigger than the top whisker,

37
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:50,255
you'd have a lot of negative skewness, it spits right out at you.

38
00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:53,756
Now, here's an outlier, you can see that X there is an outlier,

39
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:56,980
cuz it's below the bottom of the lower whisker.

40
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,990
Now, the third dimension on which we summarize data

41
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,640
is spread about the mean.

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,930
And we can see the box for Cisco is taller than the box for GM,

43
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,360
which means there's more spread about the mean.

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,560
And the whiskers for Cisco are bigger than the whiskers for

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,730
GM, which means, again, there's more spread about the mean for

46
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,210
Cisco than GM.

47
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,130
So, we've seen visually, in a minute or

48
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,670
two, the comparisons between Cisco and GM on the three dimensions we

49
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,090
care about, and I think a picture is much more powerful than numbers.

50
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,460
So a box plot is just fantastic for comparing data sets.

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,170
In the next video, we'll show you how you can do box plots

52
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,780
where you have multiple populations, but

53
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,860
multiple variables on each population.
