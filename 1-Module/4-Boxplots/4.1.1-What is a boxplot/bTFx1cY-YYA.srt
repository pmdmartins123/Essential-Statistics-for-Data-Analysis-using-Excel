00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,590
We're now gonna show you how box plots give you a great

1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,090
visual summary of one data set or multiple data sets.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,550
So let's do this with a really interesting example.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,139
It's actually a life and death example that's used by a lot of

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,790
statisticians to explain box plots.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,890
We'll talk about the 1970 selective service draft lottery in the US.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,430
This was, if you don't know your history,

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,290
the peak of the Vietnam War.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,670
So, they put every birthday,

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,610
January 1st through December 31st, including February 29th,

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,030
there was a capsule with each date, put in a big container and

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,670
they mixed them up, they thought they mixed them up randomly.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,090
They put in December last,

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,870
remember that, January 1st then February dates, etc.

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,066
Then they would pick the balls out and, basically,

15
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:47,860
January 1st was the 305th capsule picked out.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,545
January 2nd, the 159th.

17
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:52,461
And if you got a low number, like number 17 there,

18
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:55,775
you were pretty likely to be drafted and sent to Vietnam, so

19
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:58,380
obviously this was a life and death decision.

20
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,397
If you got a number of 350, then basically you will had no chance of

21
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:06,015
really being drafted, you could have enlisted, of course.

22
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:09,794
Okay, so, statisticians looked at this draft lottery and

23
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:13,271
they said it really wasn't done randomly or fairly and

24
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:17,080
the box plots will help us really figure that out.

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,450
Okay, so I'm going to show you the finished box plot first to try and

26
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,540
explain what the parts of a box plot mean, and

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,100
then we'll create this and come back and interpret it.

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,980
So, basically, for every month, okay,

29
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,750
those were our 12 populations, the draft lottery numbers for the month.

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,730
So January, there were 31 days in January, so these were the numbers

31
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,500
for the dates in January, the order which they were picked out.

32
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,800
So, for instance, that date in January was picked up very late.

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,450
That date in January was picked out very early.

34
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,150
So how could you summarize these 12,

35
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,090
366 days of draft orderly numbers very quickly?

36
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,040
Well this is what we mean by, actually, a box plot, or a box and

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,870
whisker plot.

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,475
The whiskers are the lines, the boxes are the boxes.

39
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:05,039
Okay, so what are the pieces of information you get in a box plot

40
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:06,950
about a data set?

41
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,985
Okay, well, you have the box.

42
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:12,745
Okay, the lower limit of the box is the 25th percentile of the data.

43
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:17,130
Okay, the upper limit of the box is the 75th percentile of the data.

44
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,630
And then you see inside the box, you'll see an X and

45
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,230
you'll see a line.

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,710
Okay, the horizontal line is the median, and the X is the mean.

47
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,490
So we have been talking about those things but now we can actually

48
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,920
see them, as the Chinese say, a picture is worth 1000 words.

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,110
Then you have the whisker, top whisker and the bottom whisker.

50
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,890
And now the top whisker basically is computed by Microsoft to be

51
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,050
the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range.

52
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,710
What's the interquartile range?

53
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,780
It's the 75th percentile minus the 25th percentile.

54
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,435
Or you cut it off at the top value of the data set and,

55
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:59,500
basically, outliers anything that's more than 1.5 interquartile ranges

56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,670
from either end of the box.

57
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,750
We'll see some outliers later.

58
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,756
But this gives us a really quick summary of the data sets.

59
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:10,084
We can talk about skewness, we can talk about typical value,

60
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:13,940
we can talk about spread about the mean and compare data sets.

61
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,550
So in the next video, we're gonna create the box plot for

62
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,720
the draft data, and then we're gonna see that statisticians were

63
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,300
really right, that basically this was not a fairer lottery.

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,490
Remember that we said the December dates were put in last?

65
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,855
So if you think about last in,

66
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:32,530
first out, if you didn't sort of mix those capsules up randomly,

67
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,760
you'd expect the later months of the year to be picked earlier.

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
And that's what happened.

69
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,266
And the box plot makes that clear.
