00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,200
Now, let's learn how to create an actual box plot and interpret it.

1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,550
So, let's go back to that draft lottery data.

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,760
So, in column A, we have the month, January through December of course,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,900
and in column B, we have the number which the date was picked.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,580
So, January 1st was picked 305th.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,750
December 31st was picked a 100th, December 30th was picked third.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,460
So, how can we summarize this data by month?

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,190
Well, we select the data in red, CTRL + SHIFT right arrow,

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,000
down arrow, and then we go Insert and then we'll get box and

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,610
whisker plot right here.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,160
And, I'm just gonna click on the design tab and make this be black,

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,050
I think it looks better.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,100
Okay, you can see things better.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,940
Now, there's a definite downward trend here in the ends of the year.

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,230
You can see October, November, December,

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,670
you can see that the line here connecting the medians drops down.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,788
And so, basically, that indicates that the months later in the year

17
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:04,048
seem to have, on the average, lower draft numbers which meant you were

18
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:07,466
more likely to go to Vietnam and, unfortunately, die.

19
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:11,410
Okay, and so, basically, statisticians concluded there wasn't

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,946
sort of adequate mixing of the capsules, that, basically,

21
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:18,688
the ones that were put in last were more likely to be picked first.

22
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,897
Now in 1971, they changed the mixing procedure, and

23
00:01:21,897 --> 00:01:26,284
in a homework problem, you'll do the box plot for the 1971 draft lottery,

24
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:30,700
and you'll see that this pattern at the end of the year did not exist.

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
And in our next video,

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,970
we'll do another box plot, going back to our Cisco and GM data, and

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,600
showing how we can easily compare Cisco and GM with a box plot.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,250
Probably much easier to do that than use the descriptive statistics or

29
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,761
the histograms that we used earlier.
